"""Surface revision history — snapshot before each change so edits are undoable.

A "surface" is an editable thing:
  • "home"          — the active design profile's section list
  • "page:<slug>"   — a content page's sections
  • "design"        — the whole active design profile (tokens + voice + sections),
                      captured on a theme switch / token change

Every compose mutation and design change records the **prior** state here, so
the operator (or 小爪) can undo the last change or jump back to a kept point — no
redeploy. History is capped per (surface, locale) so it can't grow without bound.

This module owns persistence only; the admin routes decide *what* to snapshot and
how to write a snapshot back onto its surface.
